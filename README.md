## Pharmacy Database Project

This is an online pharmacy website implmeneted in Django with an SQLite database. 

## Installation

First, make a python virtual environment.

You can then install the dependencies (Django, bootstrap-django5) with the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the project

Make sure the virtual environment is activated before you run!

Run the project with manage.py via the command,
```
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will then load the webpage, accessable at 127.0.0.1/8000.

The admin panel for Django will allow you to observe and edit the database. It can be accessed at 127.0.0.1:8000/admin.

An admin account is provided with User: jsloan, Password: password, but you can make your own with the command:
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
